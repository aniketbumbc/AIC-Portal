      "abstract": "With the emergence of Open Source relational databases as well as a plethora of NoSQL database options,, enterprises are actively seeking to leverage the lower costs and higher flexibility and scalability of these new options and moving away from proprietary technologies that locked them into endless upgrade cycles and high licensing costs.\r\nAccion Labs has successfully helped clients to migrate their data out of such proprietary databases into open source database platforms including relational databases as well as NoSQL databases. Further, Accion Labs has provided ongoing technical support for maintenance and administration of such databases, with the required service level guarantees that enterprises need for mission critical applications.\r\nHowever, the decision to migrate away from a proven database is not easy, and enterprises often stick to an existing  compromise to avoid the complex task of migration to a new alternative. This white paper attempts to address some of the concerns that enterprises have in adopting such open source alternatives, and also provides some case studies to demonstrate successful migration by various enterprises.",
